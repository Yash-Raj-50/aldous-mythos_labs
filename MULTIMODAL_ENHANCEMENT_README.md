# WhatsApp Webhook Enhanced Multimodal Support

## Overview
The WhatsApp webhook has been significantly enhanced to support direct image and audio processing using AWS services and Claude Sonnet 4's multimodal capabilities, while maintaining all existing text functionality.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Image Processing
- **Claude Vision Integration**: Images are now processed directly by Claude Sonnet 4 using its native vision capabilities
- **AWS Rekognition Support**: Additional context is provided through automated object detection and text recognition
- **Base64 Encoding**: Images are properly encoded for Claude's multimodal API
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Users receive detailed analysis of image content, context, and any text found in images

### 2. Audio Processing with AWS Transcribe
- **Real-time Transcription**: Audio files are transcribed using AWS Transcribe service
- **Multiple Audio Formats**: Supports MP3, WAV, OGG, MP4 audio formats
- **S3 Integration**: Audio files are temporarily stored in S3 for transcription processing
- **Contextual Responses**: Transcribed text is incorporated into Claude's response context

### 3. Video File Handling
- **Skip Processing**: Video files are intentionally skipped as requested
- **User Feedback**: Users receive friendly messages acknowledging video receipt but explaining processing limitations

### 4. Enhanced Media Pipeline
- **Multi-format Support**: Comprehensive support for images, audio, documents, and video detection
- **Size Validation**: 8MB file size limit enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of unsupported formats and processing failures
- **Buffer Management**: Efficient memory handling for large media files

## Technical Implementation

### New AWS Services Integration
```typescript
// New AWS clients added:
- TranscribeClient: For audio-to-text conversion
- S3Client: For temporary audio file storage
- RekognitionClient: For image analysis and text detection
```

### Enhanced Function Signatures
```typescript
// Updated generateBedrockResponse to support multimodal
async function generateBedrockResponse(
  prompt: string, 
  userMessage: string, 
  modelConfig: { modelId: string; useInferenceProfile: boolean }, 
  conversationHistory: Message[] = [],
  mediaInfo?: {
    url: string;
    contentType: string;
    size: number;
    data?: string;      // Base64 for images
    buffer?: Buffer;    // Raw buffer for AWS services
  }
): Promise<string>
```

### Claude Multimodal Message Format
```typescript
// For images, properly formatted multimodal content:
currentMessageContent = [
  {
    type: "text",
    text: imagePrompt
  },
  {
    type: "image",
    source: {
      type: "base64",
      media_type: mediaInfo.contentType,
      data: mediaInfo.data
    }
  }
];
```

## Workflow Examples

### Image Processing Flow
1. User sends image via WhatsApp
2. Twilio webhook receives image URL and metadata
3. System downloads and validates image
4. Image converted to base64 for Claude
5. AWS Rekognition analyzes image for additional context
6. Claude processes image using vision capabilities
7. Combined analysis returned to user

### Audio Processing Flow
1. User sends audio message via WhatsApp
2. System downloads audio file
3. Audio uploaded to S3 bucket
4. AWS Transcribe processes audio to text
5. Transcribed text incorporated into Claude's context
6. Response generated based on transcribed content
7. User receives response addressing their spoken message

## Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Existing
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret

# New
AWS_S3_BUCKET=aldous-whatsapp-media  # For audio transcription
```

## File Changes
- `route.ts`: Enhanced with multimodal support
- `package.json`: Added AWS SDK dependencies
- `.env.example`: Added new environment variables
- `test_webhook_multimodal.js`: Comprehensive test suite

## Testing
Run the enhanced test suite:
```bash
node test_webhook_multimodal.js
```

The test suite verifies:
- Text message processing (unchanged)
- Image analysis with Claude + Rekognition
- Audio transcription with AWS Transcribe  
- Video file skipping
- Error handling for unsupported formats
- Multimodal message combinations

## Production Considerations

### AWS Permissions Required
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "transcribe:StartTranscriptionJob",
        "transcribe:GetTranscriptionJob",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "rekognition:DetectLabels",
        "rekognition:DetectText"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Cost Optimization
- Audio files are automatically cleaned up from S3 after transcription
- Rekognition analysis limited to 10 labels with 70% confidence threshold
- Claude Sonnet 4 inference profile used for cost efficiency

### Performance Notes
- Image processing: Near real-time with Claude's vision API
- Audio transcription: 1-30 seconds depending on file length
- Conversation history: Limited to last 10 messages for context efficiency

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing text functionality preserved
- Existing profiles and chat sessions work unchanged
- Gradual enhancement without breaking changes
- Fallback responses for AWS service failures

The enhanced webhook now provides a comprehensive multimodal experience while maintaining the robust error handling and human-like response patterns of the original implementation.
